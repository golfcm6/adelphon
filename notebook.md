# Engineering Notebook - CS 262 Final Project

We built a game, Adelphon, where a team of runners and navigators collectively communicate to navigate a foreign map to find a treasure, while avoiding deadly animals and dangerous terrain.

This is our engineering notebook outlining key design decisions made while building Adelphon. For a more in-depth understanding to the project, find a pdf of the full report attached to this repo.
