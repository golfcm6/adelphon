# relayers have a grid that says most recent time step info for each coord
# when receive new info, update your map for animals and your map for terrain according to 

# no corruption for now
# when adding corruption, action is always don't trust that relayer (not storing intermediate state so recovery is limited)
# recovery = can you get back to state of "truth" before the corruptor

# have corruptors do random shit and see what happens - can write a lot

# setup sockets + visualizer
